# Large-Scale Chinese Data Benchmark for Face Video Anti-Forgery Identification
## Introduction
This project consists of the benchmark and the CHN-DF dataset for the paper "[Large-Scale Chinese Benchmark for Face Video Anti-Forgery Identification](https://chinaxiv.org/abs/202401.00241)."
## CHN-DF
The world's first large-scale Chinese dataset for face video anti-forgery identification, CHN-DF, can be downloaded at the following link.
